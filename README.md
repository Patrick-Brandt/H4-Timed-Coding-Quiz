# H4-Timed-Coding-Quiz
This was my 4th homework assignment for the University of Washington's Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. The assignment was to create a multiple choice, timed quiz. 

## We were given the following user story:
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers.

## Acceptance Criteria:
- GIVEN I am taking a code quiz,
- WHEN I click the start button,
- THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question.
- WHEN I answer a question,
- THEN I am presented with another question.
- WHEN I answer a question incorrectly,
- THEN time is subtracted from the clock.
- WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0,
- THEN the game is over.
- WHEN the game is over,
- THEN I can save my initials and my score.

## Programming Languages/Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS
